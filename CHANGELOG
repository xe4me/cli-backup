Upgrading to 2.4.1 ( latest stable)


1- Removed the select output event emitter => No reason for it , we should us the normal (change) on checkbox
2- Rewrote the amp-input , not dependant on Material2 anymore => performance benefit + cleaner code and testability
3- Rewrote the textarea  : Original code from material 2 was gone :D , =>
4- For model service is only for form related stuff , like formDefinitoin access and stored model access.
5- A seperate service that does the save called SaveService , all the save url should be : api-{experience-name}/save
6- A seperate service that does the submit called SubmitService , all the save url should be : api-{experience-name}/submit
7- A seperate service that does the save and submit .
8- A seperate service for profile
9- A seperate service for context
10-All the dynamically loaded components should be added to the entry-components.
11-Removed ProgressObserverService
12-Removed Section Service
13-BlockLoader is not dependent on any service any more





To upgrade experience :
1- Run amp-ng init and discard the overrides for important files , like app.component.ts and allow for the rest
2- Copy the latest package.json to the old experience
3- Find all the directives from all the components and remove them
4- All the dynamically loaded blocks should be added to the entry components of the root module
   * useful commands to find all the blocks :
  1- To find all the blocks     grep -lr "export class " ./src/app/blocks/
  2- To get all the block class names : grep -hr "export class " ./src/app/blocks/   | awk  '{print $3 }'
5- Update app.module and replace the appropriate components , add entry components which is the dynamic_blocks list created above
6- get rid of FormService everywhere
7- get rid of amp-number-only control
8- get rid of FormModelService if youâ€™re not using it
9- Use SaveService for save and SubmitService for submit
10-Adde SaveService and SubmitService to providers of root module
